### The Basics of User Experience Design

User Experience 
The user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

Product
A product is a good, service, or feature.

For the user to have a good experience the product needs to be 
- Usable 
- Equitable 
- Enjoyable 
- Useful 

- Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
- User experience is also about making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product.
- As humans, we want products that are useful, meaning they solve our problems.

### Jobs in the Field of User Experience

UX Designers have empathy 

Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation, and it's a major part of UX.

**Different Kind of UX Designers**

**Interaction designers**
Who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build.

**Visual Designers**
There are also visual designers who focus on how a product or technology looks. They might be responsible for designing logos, illustrations, or icons.

**Motion Designers**
Motion designers are another common type of UX designer. They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.

Similar to UX designers, there are also graphic designers who create visuals that tell a story or message. Graphic designers usually work on the appearance of a physical product, like an invitation or a poster, while UX designers focus on how users interact with the product.

**Most Common Colleagues a Designer Might Work With**

**UX Researchers** 
UX researchers conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.

**UX Writers**
Then there are UX writers, who think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive.

**Production Designers**
They make sure the first and final designs match the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team.

**The Assets**
The assets are everything from text and images to the design specifications like font style, color, size, and spacing.

**UX Engineers**
UX engineers translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app.

**UX Program Managers** 
UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.
