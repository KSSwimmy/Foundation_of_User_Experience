### The Basics of User Experience Design

User Experience 
The user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

Product
A product is a good, service, or feature.

For the user to have a good experience the product needs to be 
- Usable 
- Equitable 
- Enjoyable 
- Useful 

Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
User experience is also about making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product.
As humans, we want products that are useful, meaning they solve our problems.
