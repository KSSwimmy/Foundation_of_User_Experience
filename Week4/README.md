### Introduction to Best Practices for UX Design Portfolios

##### Tips for a good portfolio 
1. Establish your personal brand 
2. Tell a story 
3. Be concise 
4. Keep your navigation simple and intuitive 
5. Go beyond the template 
6. Include a diversity of projects 
7. Feature case studies
8. Make your website responsive

##### Case Study 
A case study leads the user through your design process, from the beginning to the end.


##### A case study answers these questions: 
- What was the problem you were trying to solve? 
- What process did you follow? Where did you succeed or fail?
- What insights informed your design decisions along the way?
- What was the ultimate solution, and why do you feel that solution was the best? 


##### When describing case studies, you might want to include things like: 
- the project's name and duration 
- your role on the design team 
- including your personal contributions to the project 
- the project's goal 
- the research that was conducted 
- the intended audience 
- any sketches or wireframes 
- user testing results
- the final design 
- a conclusion about what you learned in the process

### Reading: Start to Develop a Personal Brand

Your uniqueness is your greatest strength! Your perspective is different from everyone else’s and will help you stand out from other UX designers. Developing your personal brand is an excellent way to show people who you are as a designer and why your work is special.

Start by thinking of a few words and core values that you feel accurately sum up you and your work. For example, you might find that you value modern and futuristic styles, or maybe your work is playful and colorful. You'll want to reflect these personal and stylistic preferences in your personal brand. 

Your personal brand should be recognizable across all of your online presence, such as your portfolio website, LinkedIn, and UX design community profiles like Dribbble and Behance, which you'll learn about soon. Here are some pro tips to help you start to develop your personal brand.


##### Create a personal logo

A logo that speaks to you and your work is a great way to provide a quick visual of what you’re all about. While a personal logo is not required, it helps you leave a lasting impression and makes your personal brand easily recognizable. Make your logo as sleek or as quirky as you’d like, as long as it accurately reflects you as a designer! For example, your logo could build upon your initials or a symbol that represents your personality. Your personal logo should be included in your portfolio, on your social media accounts, and on your business cards, if you have them. 

##### Make the most of fonts and colors 

Fonts and colors strongly influence a user’s experience with any product. Consider this: How do you feel when you see the color blue? Do you feel any differently when you see the color red? Fonts and colors can be polarizing, and chances are, certain fonts or colors make you feel a certain way!

Be sure that the font and color scheme you choose to represent yourself are in line with the way you want people to think of you as a UX designer. It’s a good idea to use the same fonts and colors on your portfolio website, personal logo, resume and online profiles, in order to maintain consistency in your personal brand.

##### Keep your voice consistent

The written content that appears in your portfolio website and across your online profiles should have a similar voice. Your writing might be a bit more professional on your LinkedIn profile, but you want it to sound like the same person who’s writing in your portfolio. If your brand is relaxed and humorous, don’t be afraid to add a bit of that humor into your online profiles (where appropriate, of course.

##### Use graphics, animations, and photography

Imagery is another great way to cultivate your personal brand. You can make your own graphics and animations to add personality to your online profiles and highlight important information. You can also showcase your personal brand through photography, by using a consistent style or editing photos in a similar way.

##### Be yourself

Being authentic to who you are means you are less likely to do and say things that are “off-brand,” which can confuse your audience. Center your brand around who you truly are and portray an image that is the real you. The easiest way to do this is to not overthink! Post what feels natural to you and aligns with your interests, without thinking too hard about appearing a certain way.

I find myself constantly listening to music (87,330 minutes in 2018 to be exact) and like anyone else my age I'm a self proclaimed foodie. My current home is Austin, Texas but I mostly grew up in the small town of Acworth, Georgia north of Atlanta. While being fascinated with all aspects of User Experience design, I specialize in ideation, storytelling and visual design. I love diving into why and how people use things, and furthering those experiences to make them memorable.

### Behance Profile Best practices


Put your best work front-and-center

Behance is a digital artist’s portfolio, which means your work is your resume. It’s a good idea to put your best work front-and-center, so it’s the first thing people take away when they go to your profile. 

Make sure your bio offers a clear way to contact you

Behance offers messaging within its platform, making communication quick and easy. But it’s still a good idea to link to all your other professional online profiles (e.g., your professional website, Instagram Business Account, and LinkedIn) so you can grow your follower base and strengthen your connections.

Keep your gallery clean

People scan websites instead of reading them. Because of this, it’s a good idea to keep your Behance page clean and simple. The best way to give people a clear picture of your work is to only showcase a few projects. 

Keep your bio short

A Behance bio is a professional introduction. Keep it short and only include information that you think a professional connection should know. 

Step 4: Start building your online presence on Behance
Once your profile is complete, you’re ready to connect with other people! Let’s go over some best practices to consider as you build your online presence on Behance.

Best Practices
Follow artists whose work you like 

Behance lets you “follow” other artists to stay up to date on their work. Browse your curated homepage and follow artists whose work you enjoy. This lets them know you exist, and they may return the favor by following you back!

Like and appreciate other people’s work 

Behance lets you signal that you like other people’s work with “appreciations,” which are similar to Facebook likes or Reddit upvotes. You can also comment on other people’s work. Participate authentically, like and comment on other people’s work that truly interests you and start building an online community. 

Make connections with people you know and don’t know

You can use Behance to connect with people in the UX design industry. Send them messages that say you want to learn more about their company or their work.

You can send a message to someone on Behance by clicking the Message button on the left side of their profile. 

If you want to work at a specific company, consider connecting with employees at that company with a message. You can ask if they’re willing to have a 15-minute conversation about their day-to-day job and how they like working at the company. 

Some tips:

Reserve these requests for when you are actively engaged in your job search.
Be respectful of the employee’s time by coming prepared with specific discussion topics and questions you’d like to ask.
Resist the urge to ask for a job. This conversation should be informational in nature. 
This is a great way to get your foot in the door and better understand what employers are seeking.

Template for reaching out to ***someone you know*** on Behance

If you’re sending a Behance message to someone you know, remind them of how you know them and explain why you’re reaching out. A good template for reaching out to someone you know is:

>Hi [connection’s name], 
>
>It’s nice to connect with you on Behance. [It’s a good idea to then explain your relationship to the person here—whether you went to middle school together, are part of the same religious community, or know each other in another way.]
>
 >I’m starting a career as a UX designer, and I really like your work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects they've done that you like, and why.] 
>
>I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could discuss with you at some point? 
>
>Sincerely,
>
>[Your Name]
>

Template for reaching out to ***someone you don't know*** on Behance

When you send a Behance message to a person you don’t know, it’s important to be polite, honest, and direct with them. Let’s say you’re a UX designer reaching out to an employee of a company you want to work at. A good template for reaching out to someone you don’t know is:

>Hi [connection’s name], 
>
>My name is [your name.] I’ve just started my career as a UX designer, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.] 
>
>I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could discuss with you at some point? 
>
>Sincerely,
>
>[Your Name]

Link your website to your Behance profile

When you're ready, you'll want to make sure you include a link to your Behance profile/account/portfolio in your website portfolio. You can add a link to your website from your Behance profile by following these steps.

Share your work far and wide

Behance encourages you to share your portfolio on lots of other platforms. It’s a good idea to share your work on the platforms they suggest such as, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others. 

Here are some ways to make the most of each platform:

LinkedIn

LinkedIn is well-suited for sharing professional updates and links to portfolios. Find relevant groups and join the conversation. Post and share resources, along with updates about projects you are working on. Ask for feedback and interact with others in the UX industry.

Twitter

Start a thread asking for feedback on a design project you’re working on. Another option is to start a thread presenting your portfolio, sharing that you are open for work.

Facebook

Join UX-related groups, participate in the conversations, share resources and provide feedback to others. Share your portfolio for feedback and when appropriate, indicate that you are open for work. Be sure to understand each community's guidelines and rules before you start posting.

YouTube

Create a channel and post video demonstrations of an application or other UX project you’re working on. Link to your Behance portfolio in your profile.
