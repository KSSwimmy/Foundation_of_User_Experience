##### Case Study 
A case study leads the user through your design process, from the beginning to the end.


##### A case study answers these questions: 
- What was the problem you were trying to solve? 
- What process did you follow? Where did you succeed or fail?
- What insights informed your design decisions along the way?
- What was the ultimate solution, and why do you feel that solution was the best? 


##### When describing case studies, you might want to include things like: 
- the project's name and duration 
- your role on the design team 
- including your personal contributions to the project 
- the project's goal 
- the research that was conducted 
- the intended audience 
- any sketches or wireframes 
- user testing results
- the final design 
- a conclusion about what you learned in the process
