# Week 2 

### Define the User, End User, and User Experience 

##### User
A user is any person who uses a product. 

##### End Users
In addition, the end user is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.

##### User Experience 
User experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

##### UX Designer Questions
Is the product easy to use? Is the product equitable? Does the product delight the user? Does the product solve the user's problem? Answering yes to these questions are all goals of a good user experience as we previously learned. And these are questions UX designers are constantly asking themselves to create great user experiences.

### Prioritize the User
User-Centered Design Puts the user front-and-center 

##### Steps in the user-centered design process 
- **Understand** - First, understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.

- **Specify** - Based on your research, you'll narrow down which end-user problem is the most important to solve.

- **Design** - Then, design solutions to the end user's problem. This is where you'll come up with ideas for what the product might look like and actually start building the product.

- **Evaluate** - Finally, evaluate your design against your end user's needs. Does your design solve the end user's problem? You'll find out here, and you'll also do it by testing your product with real people.

- **Iteration** - Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks 


### Key Framework in UX Design 
##### Framework
A framework creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve. A framework creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve.

##### Five elements of UX design 

The five elements of UX design is a framework of steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product. The bottom layer is strategy. This is where you'll define the user's needs and business objectives. Each element refers to a specific layer involved in creating the user experience, and each layer is dependent on the one below it.

- Strategy 
- Scope 
- Structure 
- Skeleton 
- Surface 

The bottom layer is **strategy**. This is where you'll define the user's needs and business objectives.

The next layer is **scope**. This is where you'll determine what you're building. You'll decide on features and content to be included in the product.

The third layer is **structure**. You'll figure out how to organize your design and how the user will interact with it.

next layer is the **skeleton**, which you can think of as the layout. Similar to how the layout of our bones shape our skin, this layer helps detail how the design works, but just like our bones, the user won't see these inner workings.

The Surface, which is the top level of the user experience. The surface is how the product looks to the user.
##### Design Thinking 

Design thinking is a way to create solutions that address a real user's problem and are functional and affordable.

##### Steps in Design Thinking

- Empathize 
- Define 
- Ideate 
- Prototype 
- Test 

The first step is empathize, which is about discovering what end users really need and learning how to think and feel like them. You might conduct surveys, interviews, or observation sessions to paint a clear picture of who your end users are and the challenges they face.

The next step is to define the problem by creating a clear problem statement. The problem statement is a clear description of the user's need that should be addressed. The problem statement should be based on user research and it focuses the team on a clear goal.

Once we have defined the problem, we can start to ideate or brainstorm solutions.

A prototype is a scaled down version of a product that shows important functions.

And finally, we test the prototypes with users.

Testing keeps the user front and center as it gives users an opportunity to provide feedback before the product is built. Based on user feedback, you can make changes and improvements or come up with a completely new idea.

### Universal Design, Inclusive Design, and Equity-Focused Design 

##### Universal Design
"One size fits all"

When designers began considering how to include an even broader range of people in their designs, they called it universal design. Universal design is the process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations.

Even though it had the intention of being inclusive, it excluded a lot of people. It turns out one-size-fits-all isn't a great solution. As UX designers realized that universal design didn't meet the needs of every user, the approach to including people began to change.

##### Inclusive Design
"Solve for one, extend to many" 

Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like: 
- Ability 
- Race 
- Economic Status 
- Language 
- Age 
- Gender 

Inclusive design includes researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations in the process, so they can provide their unique perspectives during all phases of the design process.

*Our goal as designers is to build experiences that are accessible to users with the widest range of abilities.*

##### Accessibility
Designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities is called accessibility.

##### Equity-Focused Design
It asks designers to focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.

Instead of building products for groups of people who are currently being excluded, which is the goal of inclusive design, equity-focused design seeks to build products that meet the needs of specific individuals in groups who have been excluded in the past.

### The Importance of Accessibility 

accessibility = a11y

The 11 in the middle refers to the number of letters between the first letter in the word "accessibility" and the last letter.
##### Accessibility categories
- Motor 
- Deaf or hard of hearing 
- Cognitive 

Here's the key takeaway: If we make the design of a product easier for people with disabilities, we also often make it a better experience for everyone else.

### The Importance of Equity-Focused Design

**Equity-focused design** means thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities.

Plus, the designs need to specifically consider underrepresented and excluded groups.

### Self-Reflection Assignment: Examine personal experiences of exclusion 

> Write about your own experiences with exclusion or times when you have felt marginalized, left out, or considered less important than others for any reason. As you reflect upon your own experiences, you may find your memory in an interaction with another individual, a group setting, or in a moment when you did not see yourself reflected in the media. How have these experiences affected you personally or at work? 

***Answer***
I have a lot of experiences that I can recall, but one that stands out in particular dealt with the lack of representation in Disney princesses growing up. Now, in the present day is a beautiful time to be alive, because productions are bringing in princesses from all walks of life and I most applaud them for that.

### Self-Reflection: Consider Examples of Equitable Design

> Describe an example of equitable design in an app, website, or product that you’ve used. Or, share an example of a design that was not equitable. How did these designs impact your experience with the product?

### Design for the Next Billion Users

Next Billion Users or NBU is design for the billions of people who will be exposed to the internet who haven't been exposed before. 

##### The designer's issue list 

- Cost - The first big issue is cost. People might not be able to afford expensive phones with big screens and lots of storage. 

For example, people with fewer resources tend to buy less expensive devices with low RAM and limited storage. When a phone has low RAM, it means that the phone might load webpages more slowly and people might have problems trying to download files.

- Connectivity - Users might not have constant or unlimited access to the Internet. A lot of our Next Billion Users don't have continuous access to the internet. This might be because the data they have purchased has run out or because their network coverage is inconsistent or sporadic. 

UX designers should try to find ways to make the offline experience as rich as the online experience. For example, giving users the ability to load video offline and making sure that feature and experience is well-designed.

- Digital literacy is also a crucial issue. People might not be familiar with certain design patterns, calls to action, or icons that we take for granted. 

It's important to mention that your users might not know how to use a phone, download an app, or set up an account. Without clear guidance, they might only use the part of the app that they're already familiar with, or worse, they might stop using the app all together.

- Literacy - Some users aren't able to read. 

Some users aren't able to read or type, and others might want to switch languages on their device depending on what they're trying to accomplish. For example, a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard.

>One important thing to keep in mind when designing for the Next Billion Users is the rising use of mobile devices in emerging markets, which is changing how people use the internet. For example, a first-time internet user in rural India has very different needs and wants than a techie in Los Angeles. To put this into practice for UX design, check out this article about how designers can be more empathetic and effective when creating products for emerging markets.

### The Advantages of UX Design Tools

What are the advantages of using design tools? First, tools allow designers to prototype ideas and iterate on them. Second, tools make it easier for designers to test their prototypes. And third, design tools make it possible for multiple teams to work on the same product.

### Get to know Platforms 


##### Platform
A platform is the medium that users experience your product on, such as desktop, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays, and more.

##### Brand Identity 
In addition to having a consistent user experience across platforms, it's also important to have a consistent brand identity. In this case, the brand identity refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company.

---
### Design for Different Platforms


There's a big difference in the amount of time users spend on mobile phones compared to desktop computers. An average mobile session is 72 seconds, while the average desktop session is 150 seconds, more than twice as long.

##### Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device.

First, let's talk about responsiveness. In the past, most mobile websites were a mini version of the desktop site, which often made the mobile websites difficult to use.

##### Best Practices When Designing for Mobile User Experiences

***First***, call-to-action buttons should be placed front and center, allowing the user to easily complete the desired task, like joining an email list or adding an item to their shopping cart. 

***Second***, navigation menus should be short and simple.

***Third***, use gestures that users already do, like tapping and swiping. Gestures should be intuitive and familiar to users.

***Fourth***, design for both directions a phone might be held. We need to consider the vertical portrait view of a mobile phone and the horizontal landscape view. We want users to have an effective experience no matter how they hold their phone.

***Fifth***, reduce visual clutter. Mobile phones have smaller screen sizes, so it's important to keep the visual experience simple.

### Reading: The four Cs of designing for multiple platforms 

Successfully designing across platforms means providing users with a good experience, no matter what platform they use! As a UX designer, your job is to make sure that your designs account for and take full advantage of the unique features of each platform. When preparing to design across platforms, it’s helpful to keep in mind the four Cs: consistency, continuity, context, and complementary.  

**Consistency**: Most companies have specific design guidelines that need to be followed in order to stay consistent with their brand identity, which refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company. When designing a product, it’s essential to stay true to the company’s brand guidelines in order to maintain consistency across platforms and drive brand awareness. Maintaining a consistent design helps improve the user experience and build trust, because users can expect the design to feel familiar across platforms and products.

Take Google, for example. No matter which Google product or platform you use, you’ll find the colors red, blue, yellow, and green incorporated throughout the design. These visual design details are an essential part of building consistency, trust, and user loyalty.  

**Continuity**: To provide users with a seamless experience as they move between platforms, UX designers also have to prioritize continuity. Continuity in design means that users can maintain their progress as they move from one platform to the next. The user experience for each platform might be slightly different, but the product’s functionality should still be connected. Without continuity, users can become frustrated if the progress of their experience does not carry across platforms.

For example, imagine you’re designing a website and app for emails. A user should be able to start writing an email on their laptop, save it as a draft, and finish that email later on their mobile phone. 

**Context**: It’s also important to consider the context of each platform you’re designing for. This means thinking about when and how users prefer to interact with certain features on different platforms. 

For example, imagine that a user has an email app on both their laptop and smartwatch. They’re probably not going to compose an entire email on their small smartwatch screen, but they might still want to get notifications about new emails or read important messages. Designers have to take into account the context of the user’s situation and adapt the design for each platform accordingly. 

**Complementary**: One way to create a great cross-platform user experience is to make sure that the design of each platform adds something new for the user. 

For example, imagine you have a family member who lives abroad that you keep in touch with over email. You might write most of your emails to them through the desktop version of the product, but you might build on those emails using the product’s mobile app, which has features like adding photos directly from your phone. Taking into account how each platform could uniquely enrich the overall user experience is the best way to create complementary UX designs.

###### Examples of cross-platform experiences

Now that you have the hang of designing across platforms, check out some real-world examples of products with stellar cross-platform user experiences.  

**YouTube** 
For a lot of people, YouTube is a go-to source for watching endless hours of video content. The YouTube mobile viewing experience complements and smoothly transitions from a desktop browser. For example, the mobile app elevates YouTube’s “‘Watch History” feature, which allows users to continue watching from the place they left off in videos, on any device. In the mobile phone app, users can also access all of their playlists and upload videos directly to their channel, just like they would on a computer. 

**WebMD**
WebMD is a healthcare website where users can learn about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments related to a wide variety of medical conditions. The WebMD “Symptom Checker” allows users to click on certain areas of a body map and get a list of possible symptoms associated with those body parts. For example, a user can indicate that they’re experiencing heartburn as a symptom by clicking on the chest of the virtual body, and selecting “heartburn” from the provided list. On a mobile phone, this feature is simplified to account for the smaller screen size, but still provides the same basic functionality. On a desktop or laptop computer, this feature is more in-depth and extensive, and lays out the content differently. 

**Airbnb**
Airbnb is an online rental platform where users can list their own space to rent or book a stay in someone else’s space. Think of Airbnb like a hotel, but you stay in actual homes, instead of a commercial building. The Airbnb user experience on a desktop computer is straightforward and similar to other rental sites, where you can filter your search based on your needs. The mobile app seamlessly integrates these same features and allows for continuity throughout the booking process. You can even get Airbnb notifications on your smartwatch, which is really handy as you’re traveling to your destination.
