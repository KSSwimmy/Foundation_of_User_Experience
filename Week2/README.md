# Week 2 

### Define the User, End User, and User Experience 

##### User
A user is any person who uses a product. 

##### End Users
In addition, the end user is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.

##### User Experience 
User experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

##### UX Designer Questions
Is the product easy to use? Is the product equitable? Does the product delight the user? Does the product solve the user's problem? Answering yes to these questions are all goals of a good user experience as we previously learned. And these are questions UX designers are constantly asking themselves to create great user experiences.

Puts the user front-and-center 

### Prioritize the User

##### Steps in the user-centered design process 
- Understand - First, understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.

- Specify - Based on your research, you'll narrow down which end-user problem is the most important to solve.

- Design - Then, design solutions to the end user's problem. This is where you'll come up with ideas for what the product might look like and actually start building the product.

- Evaluate - Finally, evaluate your design against your end user's needs. Does your design solve the end user's problem? You'll find out here, and you'll also do it by testing your product with real people.

- Iteration - Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks 


### Key Framework in UX Design
