### Introduction to Design Sprints 

##### Design Sprint 
A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.

The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

Design sprints generally include five phases: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.

##### What makes a design sprint so useful? 
- Design sprints save time. 

- Your team can cut the decision-making process down from several months to a single week. 

- Create an effective path to bring a product to market.

- Prioritizes the user, putting their needs front and center. 

- Allows you to fast forward into the future to test your product and get customer reactions before making any expensive decisions.

Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these key questions: Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge? Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in? Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?
