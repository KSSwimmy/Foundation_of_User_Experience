# Week3

### Introduction to Design Sprints 

##### Design Sprint 
A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.

The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

Design sprints generally include five phases: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.

##### What makes a design sprint so useful? 
- Design sprints save time. 

- Your team can cut the decision-making process down from several months to a single week. 

- Create an effective path to bring a product to market.

- Prioritizes the user, putting their needs front and center. 

- Allows you to fast forward into the future to test your product and get customer reactions before making any expensive decisions.

Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these key questions:
- Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
- Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in? 
- Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?

### Five Phases of Design Sprints

##### Phase 1 Understand 
The understand phase sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.

##### Phase 2 Ideate 
Your team arrives for phase two of the design sprint, pumped full of inspiration and ready to ideate some solutions. To get the creative juices flowing, you start this phase by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Once you've got the team thinking, each participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas.

##### Phase 3 Decide 
By the time you reach phase three, you have a lot of potential solutions for your design challenge. Now it's time to decide which solutions you want to build. Together, your cycling app team discusses each possible solution, and eventually decides on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.

##### Phase 4 Prototype 
Finally, you'll wrap up the day by creating a step-by-step blueprint for your prototype. Next, phase four: prototype time. You're now ready to build the first version of your new app feature. At the end of this phase, you don't need a finished product, just something realistic enough to test with users.

During this phase, you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go.

##### Phase 5 Test
You reach the final phase: testing. Now it's time to put your prototype in front of users. As users test your prototype, you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch the new feature. 


##### *To recap the five phases of design sprints are:*
- Understand the scope of the design challenge 
- Ideate possible solutions 
- Decide on the most viable solution 
- Create a workable prototype 
- Test that prototype with actual users.
