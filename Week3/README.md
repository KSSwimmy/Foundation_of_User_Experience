### Introduction to Design Sprints 

##### Design Sprint 
A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.

The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

Design sprints generally include five phases: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.

##### What makes a design sprint so useful? 
- Design sprints save time. 

- Your team can cut the decision-making process down from several months to a single week. 

- Create an effective path to bring a product to market.

- Prioritizes the user, putting their needs front and center. 

- Allows you to fast forward into the future to test your product and get customer reactions before making any expensive decisions.

Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these key questions:
- Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
- Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in? 
- Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?

### Five Phases of Design Sprints

##### Phase 1 Understand 
The understand phase sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.

##### Phase 2 Ideate 
Your team arrives for phase two of the design sprint, pumped full of inspiration and ready to ideate some solutions. To get the creative juices flowing, you start this phase by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Once you've got the team thinking, each participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas.

##### Phase 3 Decide 
By the time you reach phase three, you have a lot of potential solutions for your design challenge. Now it's time to decide which solutions you want to build. Together, your cycling app team discusses each possible solution, and eventually decides on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.

##### Phase 4 Prototype 
Finally, you'll wrap up the day by creating a step-by-step blueprint for your prototype. Next, phase four: prototype time. You're now ready to build the first version of your new app feature. At the end of this phase, you don't need a finished product, just something realistic enough to test with users.

During this phase, you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go.

##### Phase 5 Test
You reach the final phase: testing. Now it's time to put your prototype in front of users. As users test your prototype, you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch the new feature. 


##### *To recap the five phases of design sprints are:*
- Understand the scope of the design challenge 
- Ideate possible solutions 
- Decide on the most viable solution 
- Create a workable prototype 
- Test that prototype with actual users.

### Plan Design Sprints

- User Research 
- Call in the Experts 
- Find the right space 
- Gather supplies 
- Establish sprint rules 
- Plan introductions 
- Post-sprint planning 

First up, **user research**. If you're lucky enough to have a dedicated researcher on your team, they can own this step. 

Next, it's time to **call in the experts**. If you're planning the sprint, it's up to you to schedule short talks with colleagues or industry experts. You'll listen to these info-packed talks during the understand phase of the sprint.

Step 3: **Find the right space**. It's important to ensure that the space allows all employees equal opportunities to perform their job. Let's talk about a few things you should look for. Whiteboards to capture your ideas or hang sticky notes, acoustics so participants can hear each other easily, accommodations for anyone who needs them, and comfortable furniture that you can move around easily. 

Once you've found the right space, it's time to **gather supplies**. If you're planning the design sprint, it's your job to make sure everyone has what they need to participate, kind of like a teacher handing out classroom supplies. Some essentials include markers, sticky notes, and a lot of snacks and water.

On to Step 5: **Establish the rules of the sprint**. If you want this to be a gadgetless, distraction-free zone, now is the time to say so. Figuring out the ground rules in advance sets the tone for the sprint, gets everyone on the same page, and helps your team stay focused. 

Step 6 is **planning introductions**. This can be pretty important since sprints involve cross-functional teams that may have never met before. We all know icebreakers can be a little cheesy, but they're still a great way to help your team get comfortable with each other. 

the final step: **post-sprint planning**. That means thinking about what will happen after the sprint wraps up, like how your team might use what you've learned to achieve other goals. To do this, you need documentation. Make sure you enlist a few people to help document the design sprint by taking pictures, collecting sticky notes, and jotting down ideas.

### An Entry-Level Designer's Role in a Sprint 

The first day is the **understand phase**, where you'll get a clear picture of the design challenge. There will be plenty of short talks by experts that are designed to inspire you. So, make note of any thoughts you have.

Phase 2 is the **ideate phase**. The sprint master will guide the team through brainstorming activities to spark creativity and generate tons of possible solutions to the design challenge. Your main focus is coming up with ideas and putting them out there.

Welcome to phase 3, the **decide phase**. Your team will decide on the solution with the greatest chance of success. As a newbie UX designer, you'll get involved in every stage of the decision-making process. When potential solutions fight it out, you'll vote for the one that has the most potential. As you might remember, at this point, you also need to start planning ahead for testing. 

**Prototype phase** 4 is all about creating a prototype of your product. As an entry level UX designer, you'll be actively involved in creating a solid prototype for users to try out. You'll ask questions, offer ideas, and review the completed prototype.

The **test phase** is the final phase of the process, where you put your prototype to the test. As a newbie designer, you might be asked to collect user feedback by observing and interviewing users. This feedback helps the team know what to revise before bringing the product to market.
